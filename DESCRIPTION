Description: Constructs, plots and evaluates constrained cubic Hermite splines, which can be used to construct monotonic and bounded splines. Computes their first derivatives, indefinite integrals and smooth approximations of their first, second and higher derivatives. Also, computes their roots/solutions, along with their minima/maxima and inflection points.
